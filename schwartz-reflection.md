*What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
	I wasn't super clear on how to clear merge conflicts in Git before the GPS. 

*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
	Again, clearing up merge conflicts was made much clearer in the GPS. A concept that wasn't clarified (in fact I now have more questions) is the process of origin fetch and merge vs origin pull. In particular when I fetched a commit that was more updated than what I had locally, I could not find where to explore which files have been changed and what changes were made before going to merge back in. 

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
	We asked a number of questions throughout the session, in particular about the process and intent for pull requests and merging on GitHub. 

*What still confuses you about git?
	As above the utility of fetch vs pull and how to compare changes against the local version after fetching 

*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
	The first pairing experience in a GPS was interesting, not entirely what I expected but overall positive. I would have liked the guide to act more like a guide/mentor/coach and less like a 3rd pair participant (very experienced and knowledgeable, but still).
