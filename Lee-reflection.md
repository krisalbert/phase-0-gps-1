#GPS 1.1 - Version Control and Git
**Kris Albert Lee | 6 October 2015**

**1. What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I wasn't really struggling with anything in particular but I have never done a pull request before the GPS so I didn't really know how to do that. I read about it last week so I had a vague idea about it but it was still a new concept that I hadn't fully grasp; I didn't really understand how to begin one, and when a pull request is helpful.

**2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

We created a pull request during the GPS. Gary and Tal answered some of my questions and also seeing it in action definitely helped my understanding of it. I also had never seen branches in GitHub before so seeing that on the site and how easy it was to switch to different branches and then merging them after the pull request was something that I learned today.

Another thing that I did before but didn't really realize what it was doing was creating new branches. I was watching my finder window when I switched branches and a file that I created in a feature branch disappeared when I switched back to master! I didn't realize that creating branches did that, it was like magic to me! I didn't realize until then just how powerful git branches can be.

One of the last things we tried was merging files that would conflict and trying to fix those conflicts and merging again. That was very cool to try first hand and is definitely something that I need practice on in the future.

**3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

I asked them about creating a pull request, and both Tal and Gary were more than happy to guide me while creating the pull request. I also asked Gary a lot about best practices in git. For example, if you were to `git add` several files and then do `git commit -m [message]`, all those files would share the same commit message - I asked what kind of message I should be putting in cases like those. Gary said that there isn't an easy answer to that question but he gave us an advice to commit early and commit often.

**4. What still confuses you about git?**

I think I am slowly getting git but I feel like I would need a lot more practice to really say that I am comfortable with it. I want to practice with more creating shared repositories and making pull requests. Also, I want more practice in how to handle merge requests with conflicts cause I feel that I would be experiencing a lot of that in the future.

**5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

It went very well in my opinion. Our GPS guide Gary was not only very knowledgable, he was also very friendly and engaged. I liked working with my partner Tal, he was very easy to work with. I feel like we were able to help each other out so that we don't get stuck anywhere. I learned a lot from them and I am looking forward to my next GPS as I know I would learn even more.
